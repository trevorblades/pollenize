        Pollenize is a nonpartisan, apolitical non-profit organization seeking
        to provide voters with the most accurate election information possible.
        We aim to make a positive impact on voter turnout and help spark
        political discussion in communities around the world.

      <Typography paragraph>
        People talk about how important it is to vote, but the information
        necessary to make a confident decision is often sparse, unclear, and
        riddled with political rhetoric and jargon. Pollenize cuts through the
        noise and brings you the most clear, to-the-point information about
        topics that really matter.
